/*What would each of these lines of code do:

    1. true && console.log("moo"):

    This line will log "moo" to the console.
    The && operator performs a logical AND operation.
    Since the left side is true, it proceeds to execute the code on the right side.

    2. false && console.log("moo moo?"):

    This line does not log anything to the console.
    The && operator performs a logical AND operation, and because the
    left side is false, it stops and does not evaluate or execute
    the code on the right side.

    3. true || console.log("hello friend"):

    This line does not log anything to the console.
    The || operator performs a logical OR operation.
    Since the left side is true, there is no need to evaluate the 
    right side, so it does not execute the console.log expression.

    4. false || console.log("bye friend"):

    This line will log "bye friend" to the console.
    The || operator performs a logical OR operation.
    Since the left side is false, it evaluates the right side to determine 
    the result, and in this case, it executes the console.log expression.

    Once you see the results, write in a comment why it works that way.
